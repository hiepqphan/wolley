## Description
Wolley takes inspiration from the sport volleyball and the anime *Tensei Shitara Slime datta ken* in which the main character is a slime.
While the game does not have a storyline, the in-game characters, slimes, are designed based on the mentioned anime.

## Installation
You can clone this repository and open the project with Unity to build your own game client. Download Unity <a href="https://store.unity.com/">here</a>.

Alternatively, the game is also available online via this <a href="https://portfolio-hqp.herokuapp.com/wolley">link</a>.

## How to play
The game has 2 gamemodes, **Classic** and **Arcade**, and 3 difficulties **easy**, **medium**, and **hard**. To change difficulty,
go to Mainmenu screen and click the setting button at the top left corner.
#### Classic
The player controls their slime to move around in the lower half of the yellow field using arrow keys. The goal is to not let the ball falls
through the bottom of the screen. The player wins when the ball "falls" through the top of the screen.
#### Arcade
The player defends the land by fighting against waves of balls falling from the sky. This is an endless mode thus the player does not win 
but tries to score as much as possible by preventing the balls from landing. Move around with left and right arrow keys, the ball will
automatically bounces off upon touch the player.
